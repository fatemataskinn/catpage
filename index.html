    <h1><b>Prrrfriends</b></h1>
    <h2><b>Introduction</b></h2>
    <p>Hi there! My name is Taskin, and I’m a 20-year-old cat enthusiast currently studying abroad. While I’m chasing my academic dreams far from home, I can’t help but miss my adorable feline companions every single day. Being a proud cat mom, my love for cats goes beyond just cuddles and playtime—they’re my family, my source of comfort, and my biggest inspiration.</p>
    <p>This webpage is my way of sharing the magical bond between humans and cats with the world. From their quirky behaviors to the pure joy they bring, cats have a way of making life better in every way. Whether you’re a fellow cat parent or simply a fan of these furry wonders, I hope my page fills your heart with warmth and joy!</p>

    <h2><i>What is a cat?</i></h2>
    <p>A cat is a tiny, furry overlord equipped with a pair of mesmerizing, galaxy-filled eyes and the power to hypnotize humans into giving unlimited treats. They are masterful nap-takers, spending 90% of their lives in deep slumber and the other 10% plotting world domination—or, at the very least, finding new ways to sit on your keyboard.</p>
    <p>Cats come with a state-of-the-art purring engine, designed to soothe your soul while sneakily making you their eternal servant. They possess ninja-like agility for knocking over your most precious possessions but will conveniently “forget” how to jump when it’s time to get off your favorite chair.</p>

    <h2>Why do people treat them like their own kids?</h2>
    <p>Cats have a unique way of capturing our hearts and becoming part of our families. Their affectionate nature, quirky antics, and ability to provide comfort make them more than just pets—they’re companions who deserve love and care like any other family member.</p>
    <h2>The psychological connection between cats and humans</h2>
    <p style="color: black;">The bond between humans and cats is rooted in psychological and emotional dynamics that benefit both species.</p> Cats offer a sense of comfort and stress relief through their calming presence and soothing purrs, which are believed to have therapeutic effects.</p> <p style= color:black>Their independent yet affectionate nature appeals to humans, creating a rewarding relationship based on selective trust and loyalty. Cats’ small size, soft features, and behaviors resembling those of human infants trigger nurturing instincts in people. Additionally, the nonverbal communication humans and cats develop, through gestures, eye contact, and vocalizations, deepens their connection. This bond has been reinforced over time, as cats have evolved behaviors that endear them to humans, ensuring their role as beloved companions.</p>
